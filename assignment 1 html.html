<div class="week2Exp">
  <p>For this week, I reflected on the feedback I got and decided to see what I could create
    with the colorful shapes that I made for the topic of anxiety, because during the week
    before, I did not experiment with ways that I can put them together.
    I had two topics to choose from and during this week I decided to choose anxiety to
  create a poster from.</p>

<div class="stage22">
  <p> After the feedback and critique I went back to the website and wanted to see what other shapes I can create that represent anxiety.</p>
</div>
<div class="stage222">
  <p>There were still the question of how to use the shapes together, I then started to experiment with how to use them together by overlapping them using opacity, and different placements.<br><br>The below images showcase this experiments. It started with the top left image, with simply placing the images together with different opacities, which did not give me successful results.<br><br>Looking at excel I discovered that there were filters available, that would change the color and of the shapes. I used the filters, and opacity, to create the bottom left image. <br><br>This design, however, was not very clear in its message and it needed a different approach. The design on the bottom right, was something I decided to go with and work on to develop furthur. 
  </p>
</div>
<div class="stage2222">
  <p> The design mentioned above was then improved and simplified, with less layers, because the original was very crowded and distracting for text that was going to be added. Adding text was a way to better communicate my message because the shapes by themselves would not do that clearly.<br><br> Glitch text was something I wanted to include to the design and tried a few layouts with it, but the simple text turned out to be better and more clear. Using the cells of excel as a way to build my letter was decided on, because this way, would go against the grain of the software.I then discovered that the glitch text and the yellow letters could be mixed together to create the —----image. 
  <br><br>The text decided on was: “Never Ending Cycle of Anxiety” <br><br>This speaks on the anxiety that seem to never end because of the situation that I was placed in because of the pandemic.
