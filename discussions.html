<div class="question1">
  <p>Question:
	  <br><br>1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools and the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? 
    <br><br>
  2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?<br><br>
	  Answer:<br><br>
	  1. The first author believes that very little control is in the hands of the designer and everything is controlled by big corporations that provide everything a graphic designer needs, or think they need. This raises the question of their influence on the creative process. The author believes that more control, freedom should be given to the graphic designer and people who use this software. The second author talks about the benefits and the problems created with open-sourced coding and/or small groups and businesses that give these resources to people. The author offers a solution or a way to solve this problem and a solution to the issues talked about by the first author. He believes that everything from big to small needs to be maintained and a “democratically organized tech sector” is needed. And neither a central power such as now should have control nor small independent groups.<br><br>
	  2. The skills needed to create and write programs that help and are personal to one's own practice or a community.

<div class="question2">
  <p>Question: <br><br>What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. <br><br>
  What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).<br><br> Answer: <br><br>I agree and think it is a useful category for understanding Schwults's argument because universal users are going to create and do what they need and they could do that to a better extent with more freedom and freedom of expression. it depends more on the user and the intelligence of the user, rather than guessing and “knowing” what the user needs and wants. The individual website created by a user shows and focuses more on the user rather than the user disappearing like Lialina says. 

I think I could describe myself as a universal user, for example, “make a black frame around pictures without Instagram, remove a black frame from an Instagram picture and even wake up at 7:00 without a ‘wake up at 7:00’ app” and using software in different ways. I could also say a regular user as well, using many software and applications the way they were intended to be used.

<div class="question3">
  <p> Quesion: <br><br>
    1. A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature.<br><br>
	 Answer: <br><br>
	 One example in nature that has programmatic patterns is cacti, like many other plants and things. The way their spikes are formed and the way in which they grow is programmatic. <br><br>

	There are lines in which the spikes are located, that spiral toward the center. The spiral is like a Fibonacci sequence of numbers, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, which the two numbers before sum up the preceding number, that spiral together into the center.  There are raised surfaces on which the spikes grow that also move and change with the spiral. The size of the spikes like the raised surface change and get smaller with the pattern spiraling in. <br><br>

	The plant's new leaves emerge from a spherical growth tip, which is made up of an outer shell and a mushy core. As the plant grows, the shell grows faster than the core, which causes the spiral ridges to form in the shell because of excess surface area, similar to wrinkles on our skin. The raised surfaces on the cactus then become places for the spikes. The perfect growth and the two different speed at which the parts grow creates this pattern or shape on the cactus. <br><br>

<div class="question4">
  <p>Question: <br><br>(from the lecture) How can embodiment play a more critical role in my own design process? <br><br>
    Answer: <br><br> By understanding and paying attention to our emotions, feelings, and sensations, we can better convey and represent them, and even further, recognize what others are feeling and how we can represent them, so it appeals to others. In our design process like said before if we think about our experience and pay much attention to it, it reveals a lot about the work, the result, the mistakes, and the issues. Therefore embodiment should play a critical role in our design process. We should ask questions about our most basic interactions with tools and things we use and try to understand and look at them from a different perspective, and even do research on them. I think being and placing ourselves where we like and enjoy specifically in a natural setting can help our creativity and it can be inspiring as well, which is helpful to our own design process. </p>
